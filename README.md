## Online Restaurant Service REST API

This repository contains a simple REST API built in JavaScript for a hypothetical online restaurant service. The API provides functionalities to manage products and orders within the restaurant's system.

Features:
- **CRUD Operations for Products:** Users can create, read, update, and delete product information.
- **Order Placement:** Users can place product orders, specifying details such as customer name, email, and selected items.
- **Order Listing:** Provides endpoints to list all orders placed through the system.

Technologies Used:
- **Node.js:** Backend runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
- **Express.js:** Minimalist web framework for handling HTTP requests and routes.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used to store product and order data.
- **Mongoose:** MongoDB object modelling library for Node.js, simplifying interactions with the database.
- **RESTful Architecture:** Follows REST principles for designing APIs, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
- **Git & GitHub:** Version control system and hosting platform for collaborative development and project management.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.
3. Install project dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the server with `node index.js`.
5. Use tools like Postman to send requests to the API endpoints (e.g., create, read, update, delete products; place orders; list orders).
